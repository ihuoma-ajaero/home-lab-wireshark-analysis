#Cybersecurity Home Lab Project 1

##ðŸ”¹ Project Title:
Network Traffic Analysis with WIRESHARK

##ðŸ”¹ Purpose:
To understand how data moves across a network and practice inspecting real-time traffic using Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer. This skill is foundational for threat detection, packet analysis, and security monitoring.

##ðŸ”¹ Tools Used:
Wireshark (installed on Windows 11 VM via Parallels Desktop on Mac)

##ðŸ”¹ Key Activities Completed:
Installed Wireshark with proper Npcap configurations

Ran packet capture while browsing the internet
Filtered traffic using expressions like:
- tcp
  
![Filtering by Protocol](https://github.com/ihuoma-ajaero/home-lab-wireshark-analysis/blob/main/filtering%20by%20protocol.png)

- ip.addr == <your IP>

- tcp.analysis.flags
  
![Filtering to detect and analyze possible flags](https://github.com/ihuoma-ajaero/home-lab-wireshark-analysis/blob/main/filtering%20for%20flagged%20traffic.png)
  
- tcp contains "admin123"

Identified unencrypted traffic and understood what kind of data could be visible in plain text

Observed different protocols: TCP, DNS, HTTP, etc.

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned:
-Not all traffic is encrypted; HTTP reveals data like URLs in plain text

-Packet filters are powerful for narrowing down network events

-Wireshark is a strong entry tool for learning how attackers might sniff sensitive data in a network


ðŸ”¹ Next Steps:
Begin Project #2: SIEM Log Analysis with Splunk

Continue building my cybersecurity home lab with more tools and proper documentation
