## ðŸ”¹ Project Title:
Network Traffic Analysis with WIRESHARK

## ðŸ”¹ Purpose:
To understand how data moves across a network and practice inspecting real-time traffic using Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer. This skill is foundational for threat detection, packet analysis, and security monitoring.

## ðŸ”¹ Tool Used:
Wireshark (installed on Windows 11 VM via Parallels Desktop on Mac)

Hereâ€™s a screenshot of my desktop before I installed Wireshark:

## ðŸ”¹ Key Activities Completed:
## Step 1: Install Wireshark with Npcap configurations

## Step 2: Run packet capture while browsing the internet
This is how the Wireshark traffic looks after capturing data:

## Step 3: Filter traffic 
- By protocol "tcp"

- By IP address "ip.addr == <your IP>"

- Detecting flags "tcp.analysis.flags"

- By string (example, username) "tcp contains "admin123""

## Step 4: Identified unencrypted traffic and understood what kind of data could be visible in plain text

This image shows "tcp contains "admin123"" filter revealing http traffic

This image shows "tcp contains "admin123"" filter revealing unencrypted http traffic and password in plaintext

Protocols Observed: TCP, DNS, HTTP, etc.

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned:
-Not all traffic is encrypted; HTTP reveals data like URLs in plain text

-Packet filters are powerful for narrowing down network events

-Wireshark is a strong entry tool for learning how attackers might sniff sensitive data in a network


ðŸ”¹ Next Steps:
Begin Project #2: SIEM Log Analysis with Splunk

Continue building my cybersecurity home lab with more tools and proper documentation
